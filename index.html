            Dear Mahnoor,<br><br>
            Ever since the moment I met you, I knew there was something special about you. Your smile lights up my day, your laughter is music to my ears, and your presence makes my world complete. I can't imagine my life without you, and I want to know...<br><br>
            Will you be mine forever?
        </p>
